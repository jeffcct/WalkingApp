# WalkingApp

This is a mobile app built with react native (& expo) for a GDSC (Google Developers Society) Hackathon. 

The theme was biohacking, and we decided to make the mobile app that forces people to run! With this app, you will get locked out of your phone unless you run a certain distance.

This was a really fun experience and we came third!
